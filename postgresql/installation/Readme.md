### postgresql installation guide


This installation should work fine for ubuntu/Debian based OS like (Kali, mint and pop os)

To process the installation process just run the following script:

With sudo right (to not be asking for password every time a sudo is required)

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

without sudo

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

After a successful installation you should see the psql version at the end
